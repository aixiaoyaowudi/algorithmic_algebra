# Algorithmic Alegbra
This project aims to develop a lite algorithmic algebra library with a user-friendly interactive interface, which can serve as either supplementary teaching material for learning or a simple calculator. The codebase plans to use C++ to build a strongly-typed template library, together with a Python interface, with the goal of implementing a series of operations on strongly computable polynomial rings and polynomial rings over algebraically closed fields. These operations include, but are not limited to, ideal theory computations, zero-point calculations, factorization computations, and resultant calculations. Currently, there is a lack of lightweight libraries in this area that are written in C++, strongly typed, and easy to read. Many existing computational frameworks also lack support for certain features, such as performing operations on polynomial rings generated from any given strongly computable ring, among others.
